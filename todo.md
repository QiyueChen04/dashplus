# remaining issues:

# parser-visitor:
if then else cases; almost like reparsing it

# well-formedness check
decide if qnames are builtins like 'plus' 'True'; check if they are overriden by user; perform checks
typecheck: see formula when expecting formula (prob use the the operators can distinguish, but not ite, let and join&join)
comprehensionValue: decl cannot contain multiplicity words 288
create LONEOF, ONEOF, SOMEOF, SETOF from cardinality, or maybe don't need to

# changes (some WIP)
- optional ( qname '.' ) in 'funPara' and 'predPara'
- optional qnames inside [] in importPara
- optional params in box rule of 'expr'
- optional block/bar in comprehension

- accept '<=' for less or equal to; not documented in book, but CUP accepts it
- accept trailing commas in 'sigPara' and 'arguments'
- accept round brackets for macroPara
- accept more symbols for the Prime token

- added tokens for arithmatic operations, ExprConstant (Alloy AST), WIP, so they are not just 'qname'
- added the 'until' keyword to the temporal operators
- added bit shift operators
- added tokens for 'none', 'univ', 'iden', 'fun/min', 'fun/max', 'fun/next', STRING_LITERAL,
                    'int', 'Int', 'steps'
- added tokens for 'pred/totalOrder' and 'disj' as a predCall list, not just qname
- added 'seq' expr as a rule (https://alloytools.org/quickguide/seq.html)

- removed the two 'boxValue' rules in 'value'

- separated the different uses of the 'multiplicity' keywords, so it's clear what they are being used for from context
- 'formula' concatenation in 'block': 
    - Before: optional AND operators, but this causes precedence issues with other binop rules
    - After: mandatory AND operators, but accept sequence of 'formula's in 'block'; this is consistent with CUP
- merged 'formula' and 'value', because 'ite' causes indirect left recursion between formula and value (starts with 'formula' in a 'value ite')
    - merged them to expr and ANTLR handles direct left recursion
    - need to check for usage of grammar rules (formula or value) in parser-visitors
    - most rules can be distinguished by the operator tokens alone, with exceptions such as 'ite', 'let', 'join' and 'box'
- integrated ITE
    - made two binop rules: 'implies' and 'else'
    - a 'ite's (ternary op) precedence is not handled correctly in the midst of other binop rules
    - used ANTLR's semantic predicates to reject 'else' if not in rhs 'expr' of 'implies'
    - parser-visitors need to check and restructure the ast, because some tricky cases cannot be handled by semantic predicates alone
- replaced ('expr' 'qname' 'expr') 
    - changed to (expr ('fun/mul' | 'fun/div' | 'fun/rem') expr) and (expr ('+' | '-' | 'fun/add' | 'fun/sub') expr)
    - placed them in the correct order of precedence
- refactored string literals in grammar rules to tokens; this improves reusability and makes for ANTLR generated Contexts classes easier to work with

precedence:
group rules together

According to book, 
3 types of expr: relational expr, boolean expr, integer expr
rost operators apply only to expr type with exceptions: conditional construct, let, join&box

- IMPLIES is not used
1) merge value and formula, but we can distinguish from operators
    with three exceptions:
        - implies
        - let
        - join&dot
2) use branch of antlr
3) rewrite rules (too hard, not maintainable)

- CUP always uses Name (allows both ID and QNAME), but in ANTLR we use both name and qname
- CUP is accepting a lot more things than the grammar defined in Book. Not sure which one to follow.

- seems like CUP doesn't create ExprBinary.Op.JOIN directly
- what is ExprCall
