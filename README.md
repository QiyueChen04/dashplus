## Building from source:

Building from source requires the java version to be >= 25. The java version can be verified by running `java --version`. Java 25 can be installed from [https://jdk.java.net/25/](https://jdk.java.net/25/)

To build the .jar file, run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/WatForm/dashplus
cd ./dashplus
./gradlew build
```

The generated .jar file is located at `dashplus/app/build/libs/app.jar`

The build process uses gradle version 9.1.0. However, installing this globally is unnecessary, since it is downloaded as part of the build process.

The build process is the same for Linux, MacOS and Windows (powershell). On cmd, `./gradlew build` is replaced by `gradlew.bat`
